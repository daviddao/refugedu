We want to explore how education can form national identities, act as a beacon of hope, provide safe spaces for children and counter the influence of extremism for youth caught in conflict zones. This panel will discuss what role should education play in resettlement, repatriation and integration. Panelists will lay a working foundation of current standards and structures in place as well as explore challenges of coordinating education in emergencies amongst International Agencies. Additional topics could include donors’ perspectives, and relations between host countries and international agencies.
