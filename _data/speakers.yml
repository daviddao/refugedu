  bio: 'Markus Kressler, born 1990, is the founder of Kiron University in Berlin, Germany. The student of psychology realized the massive obstacles refugees faced when trying to enter higher education in Germany and decided to act. With the support of colleagues and other volunteers, he has founded a university that does not insist on the formal requirements refugees are often unable to meet. German universities have already agreed to acknowledge the gained credits once the students’ residential status has been set and they are ready to transition into the formal system. Since its foundation, Kiron has expanded to Munich, Brussels and Istanbul. Mr. Kressler is currently responsible for Kiron’s expansion into Turkey and Jordan. We are delighted to have him as a speaker at our panel on refugee education and integration in Europe.'
